**Hello everyone, I present to you my latest project in Adalab, developing backend, with a REST API.**



To do this, I have first created a database in mySql, I include the code used in this repository.
This **DISNEY** database is a library of Disney characters, with the names of said characters,
in the film they appear and a sipsonis of it.
The server used is a local server that I have configured on port 6000. Once I have configured
my express server, I have designed a series of endpoints for requests to the database.


I have documented my project through the Postman tool, and the url to access said documentation
is ** https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/31173669/2s9YXnzebN.**
            


             I hope you enjoy my workðŸ˜Š
